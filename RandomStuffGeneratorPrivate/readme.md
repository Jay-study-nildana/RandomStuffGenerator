# Random Stuff Generator

Some additional code specific notes.

# CheckAndDeleteController

When testing API endpoints, especially during development, I use this controller. In most cases, it will contain some junk code or it will be entirely empty. That is fully expected because, I would have written some code and then deleted before I push the code to the public repo or to deployment.

This is not ideal, but, this repo is not meant for commercial use. Just for some learning and demo purposes.
